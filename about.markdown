My name is Pablo Samuel Castro. I was born in Quito, Ecuador. Now I live in Ottawa, but work in Montreal; both of those cities are in Canada. I am a staff research software developer at Google Brain (although I prefer to refer to myself as a _se√±or swesearcher_). My research is split between fundamental reinforcement learning, and machine learning and creativity. I play lots of music, mostly jazz on piano.

This is my blog.

I'll write about things that come to mind. Most likely about machine learning research, software engineering, creativity, music, art, LatinX, parenting, humour, ...
